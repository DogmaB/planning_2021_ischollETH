# planning-and-decision-making-for-autonomous-robots-ETH

This repository contains the programming exercises and final project for the course 'Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Robots' (Prof. Frazzoli) @ ETH Zurich.
For detailed descriptions, see the documentation in the `docs/` folder.

## Exercise 1: Lexicographic comparison

This introductory exercise implements a function that compares two vectors according to a lexicographic order. For each entry, lower is better. Such an order can be interesting when ranking and comparing constraints and constraint violations respectively plans for an autonomous vehicle.
