# planning-and-decision-making-for-autonomous-robots-ETH

This repository contains the programming exercises and final project for the course 'Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Robots' (Prof. Frazzoli) @ ETH Zurich.
For detailed descriptions, see the documentation in the `docs/` folder.

## Exercise 1: Lexicographic comparison

This introductory exercise implements a function that compares two vectors according to a lexicographic order. For each entry, lower is better. Such an order can be interesting when ranking and comparing constraints and constraint violations respectively plans for an autonomous vehicle.

## Exercise 2: Graph search

This exercise implements the algorithms for breadth first search (BFS), depth first search (DFS) and Iterative Deepening for finding paths between a starting and terminal node on a simple graph without weights on the edges. A sample result for Iterative Deepening can be seen in the following:

## Exercise 3:  Informed graph search

This exercise implements the algorithms for uniform cost search (UCS), greedy best first search (DFS) and A* for finding paths between a starting and terminal node on a graph with weighed edges. A sample result for Iterative Deepening can be seen in the following:
